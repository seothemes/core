# SEO Themes Core

Contains the required core functionality that is shared by all Genesis child themes created by SEO Themes.

## Purpose

This plugin was created as a way to keep your child themes up to date with the latest features, security fixes and bug fixes. By shifting the majority of code out of the child theme and into a plugin, we are able to provide automatic updates without overwriting customizations made to your child theme.

## Installation

1. Go to Plugins > Add New.
2. Type in SEO Themes Core in the Search Plugins box.
3. Find the SEO Themes Core plugin.
4. Click Install Now to install the WordPress Plugin.
5. Click Activate Plugin to activate it.

## Usage

SEO Themes Core will be shown in the list of recommended plugins when you activate any one of our themes and run through the Genesis [One Click Theme Setup](https://studiopress.github.io/genesis/theme-setup/) process.

Upon activation, this plugin works out which theme is currently active and provides the specific functionality for that theme. Some of that functionality includes:

- Customizer settings 
- Handy shortcodes
- Hero section
- Widget areas
- WooCommerce compatibility
- Shared CSS and JS
- Repositioning of Genesis hooks
- Useful helper functions
- Loading Google Fonts
